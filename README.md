This web application enables you to watch movies with your friends, offering real-time functionality for pause/play/skip (forward, backward) actions. It also supports playing movies directly from your local storage in case of connection issues, eliminating the need to wait for buffering or internet loading delays. You can enjoy real-time synchronized viewing with your friends, similar to a cinema experience.

Additionally, you have the option to use your preferred subtitles without affecting others. This means your friends can choose subtitles in their language while you use your preferred subtitles, ensuring everyone enjoys the movie in their preferred language.
